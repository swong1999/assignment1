                Chimpanzees are primates found across Central and West Africa. They are our closest living evolutionary relative and share many of our biomechanics and social habits. Like us, chimpanzees are highly intelligent and are extremely social, living in communities. Adult chimpanzees tend to have a special companion that they spend most of their time with, so like us, they believe in a ride or die. Maybe Bonnie and Clyde was popular amongst chimpanzees or maybe Bonnie and Clyde was actually based off a chimpanzee story. We may never know.
